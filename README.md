## Gameplay Overview

In Settler's Game, you are responsible for managing six key aspects of your colony. At the start of the game, all stats have a default value, representing the general state of your settlement.

1. **Population** - Measures the size of your colony.
2. **Food** - Represents your food reserves and ability to sustain the population.
3. **Economy** - Reflects the economic prosperity and resources of the colony.
4. **Relations** - Tracks diplomatic relationships with neighboring colonies and tribes.
5. **Morale** - Gauges the settlers' happiness and overall spirit.
6. **Defense** - Indicates the colony's preparedness against external threats.

Your settlement's fate is determined by these six stats, displayed on-screen. Choices you make can increase or decrease these stats:

- **Green (75-100%)**: The stat is in a very strong position.
- **Yellow (50-75%)**: The stat is stable but could improve.
- **Red (0-50%)**: The stat is in a critical state and needs urgent attention.

If any stat falls to 0%, the game will end, signaling the downfall of your colony due to mismanagement in that area.

The game consists of multiple scenarios drawn from historical themes and colonial challenges. Each scenario presents a situation that requires you to make a choice. Every choice has consequences that affect one or more of your colony’s stats.

### Example Scenario

> **Scenario**: A food shortage threatens your colony due to poor harvests and pests.

**Choices**:

- _"Offer incentives for increased agricultural efforts."_ - Effects: +15% Food, -5% Economy
- _"Seek alternative food sources like fishing or hunting."_ - Effects: +10% Food, -5% Morale, -5% Defense
- _"Reduce rations to make food last longer."_ - Effects: +15% Food, -15% Morale

Each choice is accompanied by a historical note that provides context and deeper insight into the challenges faced by early settlers.

The game can end in two ways:

1. **Successful Completion** - Complete all scenarios with any stats above 0%.
2. **Colony Failure** - If any stat reaches 0%, your colony fails, and the game ends.
